Chorales folder from the data folder is the input file for GAN model.
Tracks folder from the data folder is the input file for RNN model.


The outputs were stored in New_Music folder within the run folder.
0001_Tracks contain outputs of RNN model.
0001_chorales contain outputs of GAN model


Each run of the models, will be generating one musical track as the output.
Install MuseScore 3 in order to see the music sheets of the audio files.
